PickerViewKit makes it really simple to setup your picker views. You don't need to care about implementing a data source and delegate yourself. Just focus on creating your columns, rows and row models. Easily update the column(s) or rows of your picker view using a manager instance. The manager updates the data source for you and reloads the column(s).
